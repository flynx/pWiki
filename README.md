# Portable Wiki (pWiki)

### Project goals:
- Provide a simple embeddable Wiki

  This enables a zero-workflow app documentation, i.e. documentation that
  can be created, edited, tweaked and updated in-app without requiring 
  setting up and maintaining a write-convert-embed workflow.

  This was a requirement on the ImageGrid.Viewer project.

- Provide pluggable storage and synchronization

- Implement a Wiki/note _portable_ app

    - a simple and functional note/todo/outline app
    - an external/portable Wiki editor, as an alternative for in-app 
      documentation editor with ability to seamlesly synchronize with 
      the target app.
    - a stand-alone testing platform for project components


### General Documentation:
- WikiPath / [bootstrap](bootstrap/WikiPath.md)
- WikiMacros / [bootstrap](bootstrap/WikiMacros.md)
