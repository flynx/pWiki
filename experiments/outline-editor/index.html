- # Outline editor prototype
  - An outline-based markdown editor experiment
  - ### Infuences::
    - Logseq
	- Conboy (Nokia N900's Tomboy clone)
	- Bonsai (on PalmOS)
	- Google Keep (editor)
  - 
  - // Seems that I unintentionally implemented quite a chunk of the markdown spec ;)
  - ### Index
    - TOC
  - 
- ## Bugs:
  focused:: true
  - BUG: need to account for hidden elements when cursoring between elements
    - to reproduce::
      - XXX move from/to this element
      - abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
      - [ ] and to/from this (this produces a small shift compared the the above)
    - there's a simple and a complex solutions to this:
      - simple: avoid hiding stuff -- not sure if this is achivable
      - complex: estimate size of elements, including hidden ones, and account for them
  - BUG: to level headings style may not be correct...
    - # H1
      - # H2
      - some text on same level
        - # H2 (Not H3)
		  - this is not H3 because it is not under H2 (not in sub-tree) though it is on a deeper level...
		  - this is not intuitive at first glance, but is logical...
		  - Q: should we account for this?? (XXX)
  - BUG: indenting items in/out results in items below jumping down/up...
    (this only happens when in edit mode)
    - a
	- indent this line in out...
	- c
  - BUG: styling error...
    - this _seems `to` work_
    - `while` _this `does` not_
    - _seems to be connected with quoting..._
  - BUG: mobile browsers behave quite chaotically ignoring parts of the styling...
    - FF:
      - zooming on edited field
      - normal textarea is not sized correctly
    - General:
      - bullets are too close to text
      - side margins are a bit too large
        - still need to account for toolbar to the right
        - left side does not need to be as wide
  - BUG? `.code` is currently over-extended and covers the whole element area (incl. `.children`)
    - this currently has no side-effects but is not pretty (???)
  - BUG? should the following render to the save view? (currently not)
    - text<hr>text
    - text
      <hr>
      text (extra newline rendered)
    - text
      ---
      text
  - DONE BUG: caret positioning broken (ASAP CLEANUP: GETTEXT)
    collapsed:: true
    - Strategies to test:: 
      - ASAP use `getText(..)` to build the input text instead of `.innerText`
        - DONE adds 1 char offset per block element
        - this greatly simplifies things...
      - normalize `.innerText` to remove duplicate `"\n"`'s
        _(will break placement on empty lines... ???)_
      - try and build offset maps on parse
        _(potentially too complicated)_
    - *TODO*::
    - *DONE*::
      collapsed:: true
      - ```
        text text text
        ```
        text text text (a click here is offset right)
        collapsed:: true
        - the offset's amount depends on where in the text we click after the code block, the farther right the greater the offset...
        - `getCharOffset(..)` produces correct results, the problem is in `getMarkdownOffset(..)`
      - text text text
        <div>
        block element
        </div>
        this line, and above placement of completely broken
        collapsed:: true
        - the odd thing is that a nested (bug) qupted text below also breaks...
        - _this seems to be an issue with: `.getMarkdownOffset(..)`_
          - ```
            m = `text text text
            <div>
            block element
            </div>
            this line, and above placement of completely broken`
            t = 'text text text\n\n\nblock element\n\n\nthis line, and above placement of completely broken '
            getMarkdownOffset(m, t, 26) 
            ```
            this returns `69` while it should return `5`
            _...replacing `\n\n\n` with `\n\n` seems to fix the issue (also works with spaces)_
            (BUG also the above line is not italic -- can't reproduce)
      - text	text	text
      - text text text
        text text text

- ## ToDo:
  - Standalone client
    - basic pwa
	- electron app
	- cordova app
  - Item templates:
    - inline DONE
	  collapsed:: true
      - TEMPLATE
        text [cursor]
      - TEMPLATE title
        text [cursor]
    - sub-tree DONE
	  collapsed:: true
      - TEMPLATE title
        - text [cursor]
      - TEMPLATE title *boo*
        - text [cursor]
      - TEMPLATE title [new]
        - text [cursor]
    - multi-template DONE
	  collapsed:: true
      - TEMPLATE [A] [B] [C]
        - aaa
        - bbb
        - ccc
      - TEMPLATE title A
        text [cursor]
      - TEMPLATE^ title B
        - text [cursor]
    - renders as:
      - <button>title</button>
      - <select>
          <option>title A</option>
          <option>title B</option>
        </select><button>new</button>
    - action:
      - duplicate template text / subtree (w.o. markers)
      - select / place cursor at cursor marker
	- TODO:
      - nested templates??
      - global templates -- or should this be an external macro???
      - revise syntax
      - templated lists -- a list that uses a template for it's items
        - something like:
          - or here there is an explicit item template
            - TEMPLATE new
              - [ ] [cursor]
            - [ ] A
            - [ ] B
            - [ ] C
        - and a shorthand for todo:
          - TODO in lists like this new items will be created with a todo template
            - [ ] A
            - [ ] B
            - [ ] C
  - Time to think about a standalone client -- at least to edit own notes as a test...
    - _also this would be a nice opportunity to start the move to a newer electron version_
    - Deployment:
      - html
  	  - constructor
  	  - events/callbacks
        - basic storage adapters (LocalStorage/SessionStorage, FileAPI, IndexDB???)
          - _...Did I say that I hate how they crippled the FileAPI to the point
            that it is only usable for cool demos and not usable for any serious 
            applications..._
  	  - plugin API (???)
      - web component
        collapsed:: true
  	  - tag/attrs
  	  - resolve issues and unify text containmet:
  	    - `value=...` attr
  		  quote escaping (editing html/export/save)
  	    - tag body
  		  escaping html stuff
            escaping `</outline-editor>` in code
  	    - custom escaping api per input/output stream/source...
  	  - events
        - basic storage adapters
  	  - plugin API (???)
  	  - XXX load issues???
      - file editor (electron/web)
      - notes (pWiki/electron/web)
  - custom element / web component
    - BUG: select via double/triple clicks does not work...
	  - _looks like something is refocusing the element..._
    - BUG/race: the non-value versions of custom elem seem to sometimes get loaded as empty...
    - DONE data interface:
	  collapsed:: true
      - the "natural" way to pass data is to use the same mechanism as `<textarea>` the problem is that we can't extend `HTMLTextAreaElement` as it can not have shadow dom (reject?)
      - adding an explicit textarea element is an odd requirement (reject?)
      - seems that the least bad way to go is to use the `value` attribute
    - DONE API: directly mixin Outline?
    - DONE `.value` / `.code` should be both updated internally and also load new content when updated externally -- not yet sure how...
    - events 
    - test nesting...
    - Q: can we get rid of the editor block??:
      - CSS breaks if we do...
      - need to figure out a way to handle autofocus for host/editor uniformly 
    - 
  - ASAP: FEATURE: images as blocks...
  - ASAP: expand sub-tree on follow link...
  - ASAP TEST: attributes: finalize base mechanics...
  - attributes: need to show/hide the attributes -- option?
    attr::value
    - DONE `.__parse_code__(..)`: add data attributes to code if missing...
    - DONE do we need `.__code_attrs__` / `.__view_attrs__`??? -- YES
    - DONE delete attr from code -- by setting it to `"null"` or `"undefined"`...
    - delete attr from code -- by removing it from attr list (when shown)...
    - DONE BUG? can't set `''` as attr value -- parser??
  - TOC: tweaking: add args like depth, ... -- as attributes...
  - TOC: persistently generate as code (option)
    - ```
      TOC
      ```
      should turn into:
      ```
      TOC
      \- [moo](#moo)
          \- [foo](#foo)
      ```
      shown as:
      ---
      \- [moo](#moo)
          \- [foo](#foo)
      ---
    - ASAP check if we can add blocks during element handling...
    - the main problem here is where to get the data for the index?
      possible sources:
      - JSON -- preferred
      - DOM -- current
      - text
    - DOM/JSON would require a post-load generation stage...
  - export auto-headings as normal/manual markdown headings...
    - add plugin callback on `.text(..)` / ...
  - Might be a good idea to think how to avoid the constant selections on focus...
  - Focus of elements needs cleanup...
    - navigation up/down to a root element is a bit jumpy...
  - add loading spinner -- `.loading` class set on `.load(..)` and unset when done...
    - DONE set/unset class
    - add animation
    - make this extensible from client...
  - Q: When moving up/down between nodes do we want to place the caret relative to markdown (current) or to view? (see: `CARET_V_MOVE`)
  - Q: Should tables be text-based markdown or higher-level?
    collapsed:: true
    - for reference a normal table
      - | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
        | moo | foo | boo |
        | 1 | 2 | 3 |
    - block-based -- adjacent blocks in table format (a-la markdown) are treated as rows of one table...
      - here is an example
      - | col 1 | col 2 | col 3 |
      - | A | B | B |
      - | 1 | 2 | 3 |
      -
      - need to align columns -- not sure how (CSS preffered)
      - _in terms of syntax I like this the most..._
        - _...but it can lead to implementing own table align algorithm (not sure I want to go this way!)..._
    - block-children -- similar to how lists are done now
      - a demo
      - --table--
        - | A | B | C |
        - | 1 | 2 | 3 |
        - | moo | foo | boo |
      -
      - the header may be used as::
        - header row
        - caption text
        - both?
      - Q: how do we handle indenting a table row?
      - Q: how do we handle unmarked text?
      - edit mode needs work...
      - this feels a bit over-restricted...
      - 
    - might be fun to make the general syntax (after removing "-") to be compatible with markdown... 
    - might also be fun to auto-generate (template) new blocks within a table...
    - this would greatly simplify table navigation and creation
    - might be a good idea to fill the new elem with a row template...
      - creating a new line after this (line 2 as an example) 
      - | A | B | C |
      - |  |  |  |
      -
  - node selection
    - DONE multiple node selection (via shift+motion)
      - fixed state -- while `shift` pressed select or deselect only depending on first action (a-la FAR)
    - DONE double/triple click working...
    - delete
    - copy/cut/paste (???)
	  - _idea: cope as code and parse on paste..._
    - touch/mouse (???)
  - Q: should we select text through multiple nodes??
    - _...should this turn into node selection as soon as node boundary is crossed???_
  - copy/paste nodes/trees
  - numbered lists: add counters to a depth of 6-7...
    - _or find a way to make them repeat..._
  - FEATURE: read-only mode
  - FEATURE: auto-shift done blocks to the end of siblings... (option?)
    - ...or should this be `sort:: done` -- i.e. sort children by done status??
  - codeblock as a block
    _...if only whitespace before/after clear it and style whole block..._
    _...might be a good idea to do this with codeblock at start/end of block..._
    - Code blocks and bullets:
      - ```
        code
        ```
      - _bullet should be either in the middle of the block or at the first line of code (preferred)..._
  - export html
    - embed css
    - cleanup html
    - generate ideomatic html (???)
  - style attrs (see: [attrs](#attributes))
  - FF: figure out a way to draw expand/collapse bullets without the use of CSS' `:has(..)`
  - table inline editing a-la code editing -- click cell and edit directly...
  - smooth scrolling
    - _...this is more complicated than adding `behavior: "smooth"` to `.scrollIntoView(..)` as scrolling animation will get interrupted by next user input..._
    - need to cancel animation if things are moving too fast...
    - make this generic (???)
  - JSON API
  - cli
  - Q: do we use \\t for indent? (option???)
  - Q: persistent empty first/last node (a button to create a new node)?
  - Q: search?
    - _seems that search should be external to the editor_
  - empty item height is a bit off...
  - Nerd fonts (option???)
  - FEATURE: `collapse-children:: true` block option -- when loading collapse all immediate children
  - FEATURE? block templates...
    collapsed:: true
    - something like: `TPL: [_] <editable/> -- <editable/>`
      - `TPL:` -- template marker
      - `<editable/>` -- field marker
      - each child node will copy the template and allow editing of only fields
      - not clear how to handle template changes...
  - DONE attributes: might be a good idea to prevent setting `.text` and `.children` attrs...
  - DONE TOC: Q: should we have both manual and auto headings???
    collapsed:: true
    - IMHO: no...
  - DONE attributes: need a way to remove attributes from editor -- `null` or `undefined` special values??
  - DONE attributes: `.data(..)`: read in element attributes...
    collapsed:: true
    - TEST: this item has attr `moo` with value `"foo"`
      moo::foo
  - DONE TOC: headings that do not show up in toc -- `# ...` shows up while `@ ...` does not...
  - DONE \TOC global/local
  - DONE FEATURE dynamic headings -- level depends on number of headings above...
    - DONE Experimental syntax:
      ```
      @ Heading
      ```
    - Target syntax:
      ```
      # Heading
      ```
    - would be logical to (???):
      - only first top level heading is level 1
      - subsequent top level headings all level 2
  - DONE `.json(..)`, `.data(..)`, ... should be signature compatible with `.get(..)` (???)
  - DONE Q: Should we use `HTMLTextAreaElement.autoUpdateSize(..)` or handle it globally in setup???
    collapsed:: true
    - _...I'm leaning towards the later..._
    - currently solved passively...
  - DONE place the caret when moving between nodes
  - DONE selecting expanded code by _click-n-drag_
    collapsed:: true
    - # this is a test
      string with
      some extra words
  - DONE `backspace`/`delete` in block contract the field with a delay...
    collapsed:: true
    - _...looks like we are updating size on keyup..._
  - DONE Q: should list bullets be on the same level as nodes or offset??
    collapsed:: true
    - A) justified to bullet:
      ```
      * list item
      * list item
      block text
      ```
      _This is impossible to create in the current implementation_
    - B) justified to text _(current)_:
      ```
      * list item
      * list item
        block text
      ```
  - DONE add horizontal scroll to code blocks...
    collapsed:: true
    - ```html
      <outline-editor session-storage="outline-text" value="initial text"></outline-editor>
      ```
  - DONE trailing whitespace is ignored in `.view`...
    collapsed:: true
    - demos:
      -
        leading whitespace...
      - trailing whitespace...
        
      - empty block\:
        - 
          
          
    - _it seams that HTML ignores the last newline if it is not followed by anything_
    - there are four ways to deal with this:#
      - trim whitespace on refocus (option)
      - show whitespace in both modes (option)
      - REJECT remove trailing whitespace completely on refocus (a-la logseq)
      - REJECT keep current behavior
    - I do not believe in keeping whitespace in edit and hiding it in view (POLS)
  - DONE add options to save to `.sessionStorage` / `.localStorage`
  - DONE might be a good idea to focus the prev (empty) node if pressing `Enter` at 0 position
    collapsed:: true
    - <- place cursor here and press enter
  - DONE make `---` block not show list bullets...
  - DONE: undo: checkboxes and DONE??
    collapsed:: true
    _...this should be triggered by text change -- move current implementation to .__editedcode__()??..._
  - DONE undo 
  - DONE crop: make path clickable
  - DONE Q: crop: should we control crop via "crop-in"/"crop-out" instead of crop/uncrop??
    collapsed:: true
    - _crop-in/crop-out seems more natural..._
  - DONE crop: show crop path (and depth)
  - DONE over-travel pause -- when going fast over start/end stop...
  - DONE focus:
    collapsed:: true
    - DONE `<editor>.autofocus`
	- DONE `focused:: true` attr (`.text(..)`/`.json(..)`/`.load(..)`)
	- DONE focusing editor -> focus focused block
  - DONE identify a block:
    collapsed:: true
    - DONE index (flat)
	- DONE path (index)
    - DONE id
	  - _the id attr is done, but we still need to get the node via id_
  - DONE pgup/pgdown/home/end buttons
  - DONE FEATURE: "crop" -- view block tree separately...
  - DONE unify attr parsing
    collapsed:: true
    - _now duplicated in `.parse(..)` and `.__code2html__(..)`_
    - might be a good idea to add a special text parse stage and use in on both branches...
  - DONE attrs in editor are not parsed correctly (see: [attrs](#attributes))
  - DONE multiple attrs are not handled correctly (see: [attrs](#attributes))
  - DONE call `.sync()` on all changes...
  - DONE show list bullet if node is empty but edited...
    collapsed:: true
    - _...not sure which is best, so both options are available, see: `editor.css`_
  - DONE Q: can we get the caret line in a textarea???
    collapsed:: true
    - _...this will fix a lot of issues with moving between blocks in edit mode..._
  - DONE Q: can we place the cursor on item click where it was clicked before before the code expanded?
    collapsed:: true
    - for example
      - #### Click in this line and see where the cursor goes
    - _not sure how..._
  - DONE click to select/edit node must retain click position in text...
  - DONE checkbox navigation via `alt-<arrow>`
    collapsed:: true
    - _might be a good idea to include also TODO/DONE navigation -- not yet sure how to mark undone blocks (i.e. the ones marked with TODO in Logseg)..._
    - toggle with `space`
    - navigation auto-selects first checkbox
  - DONE editor: backsapce/del at start/end of a block should join it with prev/next
  - DONE editor: pressing enter in text edit mode should split text into two blocks
  - DONE editor: shifting nodes up/down
  - DONE Q: can we edit code in a code block directly? (a-la Logseq)
  - DONE "percentage complete" in parent blocks with todo's nested
  - DONE `.editor .outline:empty` view and behavior...
  - DONE editor: semi-live update styles
  - DONE do a better expand/collapse icons
  - DONE loading from DOM -- fill textarea
  - DONE focus management
  - DONE mouse/touch controls
  - DONE navigation
  - DONE expand/collapse subtree
  - DONE shift subtree up/down
  - DONE create node
  - DONE edit node
  - DONE serialize/deserialize
  - DONE add optional text styling to nodes

- ## Refactoring:
  - Q: Implementation: JSON-based, DOM-based (current) or both?
    - implement JSON-based
	- compare and decide...
  - Plugin architecture
    - DONE basic structure
    - plugin handler sequencing (see: `<editor>.setup(..)`)
    - DONE plugin handler canceling (see: `<editor>.runPlugins(..)`)
  - DONE Item parser (`.__code2html__(..)`)
    collapsed:: true
    - DONE split out
    - DONE define a way to extend/stack parsers
  - DONE Format parser/generator
    collapsed:: true
    - DONE split out
    - DONE define api (see: `<editor>.__code2text__(..) / <editor>.__text2code__(..)`)
  - CSS
    - DONE nested rules (experiment)
    - separate out settings
    - separate out theming
  - Actions -- move user actions (code in `.keyboard`) into methods
  - Move to `keyboard.js`
  - Q: do we need a concatenative API??
